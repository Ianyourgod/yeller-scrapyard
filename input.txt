the funshun numbered 1 is integer_meaning_whole_in_latin_with_exactly_thirty_two_bits shall be equal to main left_bracket right_bracket left_parenthesis
return i shall invoke the funshun named fib and it shall take the parameters left_brace 5 right_brace period
right_parenthesis
the funshun numbered 2 is integer_meaning_whole_in_latin_with_exactly_thirty_two_bits shall be equal to fib left_bracket count is integer_meaning_whole_in_latin_with_exactly_thirty_two_bits right_bracket left_parenthesis
i am declaring a variable named friendly is integer_meaning_whole_in_latin_with_exactly_thirty_two_bits shall be equal to 0 period
in the case that count is zero do return 1 period
in the case that left_brace count minus 1 right_brace is zero do return 1 period
return i shall invoke the funshun named fib and it shall take the parameters left_brace count minus 1 right_brace plus i shall invoke the funshun named fib and it shall take the parameters left_brace count minus 2 right_brace period
right_parenthesis
