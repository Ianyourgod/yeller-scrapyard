the funshun numbered 1 is integer_meaning_whole_in_latin_with_exactly_thirty_two_bits shall be equal to main left_bracket argc is integer_meaning_whole_in_latin_with_exactly_thirty_two_bits right_bracket left_parenthesis
i am declaring a variable named _variable is integer_meaning_whole_in_latin_with_exactly_thirty_two_bits shall be equal to 10 period
i am declaring a variable named counter is integer_meaning_whole_in_latin_with_exactly_thirty_two_bits shall be equal to left_brace 1 plus 1 right_brace times 0 period
during the period that _variable is not zero do left_parenthesis
counter shall now be equal to counter plus _variable period
_variable shall now be equal to _variable minus 1 period
right_parenthesis
return counter period
right_parenthesis
